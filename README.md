## About Project

Implemented an API fetch of my GitHub portfolio, and showed a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub(with implementation of pagination for the repo list), and created a single page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes while using all the necessary tools in react. I also implemented a proper SEO, Error Boundary and 404 page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
